# Numeric comparisons (numbers only)

# In Bash test ([ ]), you use arithmetic operators:

# -eq → equal to

# -ne → not equal to

# -gt → greater than

# -ge → greater than or equal to

# -lt → less than

# -le → less than or equal to


# String comparisons (strings only)

# For string conditions, you use different operators:

# = → strings are equal

# != → strings are not equal

# -z → string is empty (zero length)

# -n → string is not empty
